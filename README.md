# Mission-to-Mars
The purpose of this activity is to learn webscraping. This is achieved using beautiful soup and splinter. Then Mongo is used to store the data and Flask is used to display it. Finally, using HTML and Bootstrap the image is formatted and displayed.

Deliverable 1:
create code to scrape data from multiple sites about Mars: Latest news, a recent image, a facts table, and finally 4 images of the hemispheres.

Deliverable 2:
Used the code for scraping along with Flask and Mango to gather, store, and display the data about Mars.

Deliverable 3:
Use Bootstrap to format the html. Make the site mobile friendly. Additional Changes:

2. Use Blockquote to format News header
3. Change the heading size for the Mars Facts
